# Open in browser:
http://localhost/your-project/setup_test_users.php

# Copy the SQL
# Paste in phpMyAdmin SQL tab
# Execute
```

### 3. Test Each Role (10 minutes)
```
Admin Login:
- Email: admin@example.com
- Password: admin123

Teacher Login:
- Email: teacher@example.com
- Password: teacher123

Student Login:
- Email: student@example.com
- Password: student123
```

### 4. Take Screenshots (10 minutes)
